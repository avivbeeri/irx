# IRX - A fantasy computer toolchain

Inspired by [uxn](https://100r.co/site/uxn.html) and its goal of 
devising a clean-slate computing stack for salvaging arbitrary hardware,
I thought I'd dip my toe into the waters with my own design.

Enter: irx - instructions, registers, execution.

irx is an 8-bit register machine with a 16-bit data address bus.
This means that irx can only address a maximum of 64 kilobytes of memory.

##Â Registers 

irx has a selection of 8-bit registers.

 * A, B, C, D, G, H - General purpose registers. These are paired for certain 
16-bit operations. The A register is used for accumulator operations.
 * E, External address register
 * SP - Stack Pointer, 8-bit.
 * F - Flags (Zero, Carry, Error)
 * IP - Instruction Pointer, 16-bit

Flags in the F register are arranged like this:

  7|6|5|4|3|2|1|0
  ---------------
  U|U|B|I|O|N|Z|C

0) Carry
1) Zero
2) Negative
3) Overflow
4) Interrupt-Enable
5) Break (software-interrupt)
6) Unused
7) Unused

The irx instruction set supports a data stack of 256 bytes. Subroutine 
calls use two-bytes and an interrupt consumes three. The stack grows 
downwards from memory address 0xFFFF.

## Instruction Set

irx's instruction set is still in development.
